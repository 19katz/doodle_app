# CS279r Assignment: [Tier 2] Implement a user-testable version of Doodle

This code creates the basic functionalities of the characteristic that distinguish Doodle's scheduling app for users entering their availability.

Authors: Eshika Saxena and Kat Zhang

## Key Distinguishing Characteristics

We defined the distinguishing characteristics of Doodle as follows:

* User must be presented with date options for a meeting.
* User must click each date option to toggle between the indicators of "yes, maybe, and no."
* App must contain basic instruction corresponding colors to the signals of "yes, maybe, and no" and indicating # clicks needed. 
* User must be able to submit their availability.
* User should be able to enter their name and email.

These are the characteristics that make Doodle different from other scheduling apps.
